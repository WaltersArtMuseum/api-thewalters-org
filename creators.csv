Relying on his remarkable imagination and his profound knowledge of his subjects' anatomy, he modeled powerful images of animals alone or engaged in fierce combats. So gifted was he as an animal sculptor that the influential critic Théophile Gautier proclaimed him the ""Michael Angelo of the Menagerie."" But Barye was equally talented at sculpting the human figure. His skills in this regard are familiar to Baltimoreans who regularly encounter his four allegorical groups, War, Peace, Order, and Force, on the marble balustrades in Mount Vernon Place. He was he teacher to the sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917), but he also provided inspiration to later artists, including the French modernist, Henri Matisse (1869-1954), and the American painter and sculptor Frederic S. Remington (1861-1909).

Barye is remembered for monumental works commissioned by the state as well as for small, intimate sculptures intended as household ornaments. Various Parisian foundries cast his sculptures in multiples, thereby providing affordable art to the rapidly expanding middle classes.

Barye's paintings are less well known. In the late 1820s, he started to use watercolors, and during the course of his career he produced over 220 paintings in this medium. Although they were never exhibited during his lifetime, Barye also worked in oils. Nearly sixty canvases were found in his studio after his death. As in his sculptures, animals, both native and foreign, were the subjects of most of his paintings, but he also produced landscapes and a few portraits."," (French, 1795 - 1875)","219, 1119, 2243, 3410, 3422, 4465, 5685, 7213, 8279, 8293, 9809, 9817, 10200, 10834, 11147, 13499, 15128, 15699, 16681, 16952, 17046, 17383, 17667, 17985, 17935, 5349, 18041, 18870, 9070, 19371, 16877, 17548, 10789, 19566, 19596, 19855, 18569, 13924, 15925, 3282, 17017, 4184, 16637, 16699, 9140, 19628, 19768, 17204, 11070, 17221, 11232, 17607, 17739, 12721, 13202, 13206, 5498, 13602, 6257, 14253, 8328, 1098, 1925, 2803, 8652, 1258, 14405, 14756, 9658, 6189, 6495, 6505, 4519, 15222, 15411, 10466, 17503, 5735, 1323, 1985, 2575, 2889, 4199, 4823, 4824, 4922, 5782, 7504, 7715, 8360, 8690, 9927, 11002, 11334, 11140, 11141, 11446, 12855, 13325, 13329, 13609, 2177, 1550, 4856, 4362, 8853, 5797, 821, 15304, 15308, 3071, 9801, 16174, 7809, 7836, 12925, 8029, 8417, 16274, 9945, 19980, 20077, 20101, 20127, 20466, 21028, 21191, 21220, 21903, 22083, 22333, 23307, 23758, 23944, 23970, 24007, 24149, 24477, 24624, 24987, 25163, 25261, 25415, 25490, 25604, 25647, 25907, 26453, 27251, 27412, 27686, 28007, 28031, 28068, 28213, "

The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, he enjoyed a substantial private income by the early 1820s and did not have to concern himself with producing works to satisfy the market. He pursued an academic training, which informed his life-long attachment to historical landscape painting. He regularly exhibited mythological and literary subjects at the Paris Salon over some five decades. At the same time, he was an avid traveler, and his naturalistic outdoor oil sketches made around Italy and France are today the best-known aspect of his work. Such studies were an important influence on the young impressionists such as Camille Pissarro (1831-1903) and Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919).

Corot believed that the most elevated kind of art was the product of poetic re-creation in the studio. In the later part of his life, as his health declined, he produced an increasing number of ""souvenir"" works informed by his exceptional visual memory. During a period of rapid social change, such works offered an escape into an idyllic and timeless past. He also produced several late portraits of female models dressed in a range of orientalist and Italianate costumes.

Perhaps the most notable aspect of Corot's practice of repetition was his extensive output of reductions of his major works, particularly in the 1850s and 1860s. Many of these were commissioned by the expanding number of dealers in Second Empire Paris. Sometimes they were produced in collaboration with his students such as Achille Oudinot (1820-91)."," (French, 1796-1875)","938, 1012, 5511, 9373, 10405, 26866, 35281, 40701"

"3590","David, Jacques-Louis","Jacques-Louis David","https://art.thewalters.org/browse/creator/jacques-louis-david","male","David's remarkable career encompassed some of the most momentous political upheavals in the history of modern Europe. A highly original artist, David functioned as a visual propagandist, promoting the civic ideals of the 1789 French Revolution as well as those of Napoleon's empire. At one time a close associate of Maximilien Robespierre, a leading figure in the Revolution, he was subsequently enlisted as ""premier peintre"" (first painter) to the upstart Corsican general who would be emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte. Following the abdication of Napoleon and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814, David was forced to go underground, eventually settling in Brussels, where he remained in exile until his death.

David's participation in Revolutionary politics (he was among those who voted to condemn Louis XVI to the guillotine and held official posts on several powerful committees) should not overshadow the artistic revolution that he set in motion. Repelled by 18th-century academic norms, which tended toward a graceful but artificial stylization, he looked instead to a diverse array of 17th-century sources for inspiration. David's synthesis of the Classicism of Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665), the Colorism of Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), and the Realism of Caravaggio (1571-1610) fed into his complete re-imagining of the antique past. He painted unforgettable history paintings of subjects that had an immediate emotional resonance with his French compatriots of the moment, whether the pre-Revolutionary idealism of the ""Oath of the Horatii,"" (1784) or the imperialist ""Coronation of Napoleon,"" (1805-07). David's sustained influence in the later 19th century was assured by the success of his many gifted pupils, whom he often employed as copyists and collaborators. They would also become his rivals, ultimately usurping David's leadership of the French school."," (French, 1748-1825)","16585"

Although he had a privileged upbringing, Degas spent most of his life choosing not to fit in, intentionally separating himself both in society and in his profession with his experimental style. He took as his subject matter the leisure activities of the bourgeoisie, such as the ballet and horse racing. Although his works appear effortless, they are, in fact, the culmination of an extensive working process.

He began his career by copying the works of the Old Masters at the Louvre Museum. Because of this formative experience, Degas developed a great respect for the countless studies Renaissance artists made in preparation for each finished work. Like the art of his hero, Jean-Dominique-Auguste Ingres (1780-1867), Degas's art can be characterized by its additive, linear qualities. Degas would take partial studies leftover from some larger project and redraw them, repeatedly turning a simple sketch into a fresh project. Using tracing paper, he would often transfer or recombine figures from different unfinished attempts, continuing to add to the composition as it literally expanded through attached sections of paper or canvas or both.

Degas's art reflected both his taste for Classicism and an admiration of non-Western art such as Japanese wood-block prints. His process was also unique in that it depended upon a cross-fertilization of photography, sculpture, drawing, and painting. Degas obsessively reworked his art, shifting from one medium to the other in a fluid process that resulted in multiple improvisations on any given theme."," (French, 1834-1917)","21009, 21331"

While the subject matter to which Delacroix was attracted often derived from literary sources such as Shakespeare or Lord Byron, it would be wrong to treat the art of Delacroix as simply the visual counterpart to literary Romanticism. He was, perhaps, even more important, the last of the great history painters in the Davidian tradition. His most famous painting features an allegorical personification of ""Liberty Leading the People"" (1830, Louvre Museum, Paris) that is just as ambitious in its political rhetoric as Jacques-Louis David's pre-Revolutionary masterpieces. Delacroix viewed monumental, public commissions for decorating the walls of the Palais Bourbon (1833, now the Assemblée nationale) and the ceiling of the Apollo Gallery in the Louvre (1850) as the consummate achievements of his career.

In 1815, Delacroix entered the studio of Pierre Guérin (1774-1833), one of David's most talented pupils, where he painted alongside the slightly older Théodore Géricault (1791-1824), another painter who started out with the ambitions of the Davidian school but was soon identified with the newer current of Romanticism. He was also a devoted student of the greatest artists of the past, spending many hours at the Louvre, where he could see paintings by Raphael, Titian, and Rubens. Delacroix's highly expressive manner of painting, applying bold colors with turbulent strokes of the brush, was the perfect means of translating in paint the passionate nature of the subjects to which he gravitated. Although the allegorical wall paintings that Delacroix labored to complete for such prestigious locales as the Hôtel de Ville (city hall) were considered important by his peers, the smaller easel paintings of exotic subjects have become his best-loved works."," (French, 1798-1863)","355, 16288, 3360, 4738, 3792, 21065, 35788, 40613, 79164, 34776"
"6497","Delaroche, Paul","Paul Delaroche","https://art.thewalters.org/browse/creator/paul-delaroche","male","After completing his formative years of training in the studio of Antoine-Jean Gros (1771-1835), one of Jacques-Louis David's most gifted pupils, Delaroche quickly established himself as a popular favorite. In canvases such as ""Joan of Arc"" (1824, Museum of Fine Arts, Rouen) and the ""Death of Queen Elizabeth"" (1828, Louvre Museum, Paris), he combined a dramatic flair in his choice of narrative moment with an antiquarian's eye for the historical past, magically brought to life through his dazzling representational skills. As would his student Gérôme, Delaroche took full advantage of the reproductive technologies available to the painter to disseminate his work. Most of his major paintings were immediately translated into reproductive prints, which circulated his Salon successes to a broad international public. This process of diffusion through reduced replicas, reproductive prints, and photographs was employed very effectively in the case of Delaroche's most important public commission, ""The Hemicycle of the Fine Arts"" (1841), which he created as a monumental mural for the amphitheater of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. It made him so famous that he never felt the need to exhibit at the public Salon again.

Delaroche was considered by his contemporaries to be one of the most important painters in France. However, his name has grown unfamiliar, largely due to the disfavor his art has endured in the wake of Modernism's hostility toward the kind of anecdotal history painting that Delaroche popularized in the 1820s and 1830s. In recent years, art historians have begun to rehabilitate Delaroche's critical reputation. His art provides what would otherwise be a missing link between Davidian Neoclassicism and the polished Academicism of Delaroche's student, Gérôme."," (French, 1797-1856)","8491, 13453, 23814, 23930, 22037, 39078, 7197"

His work shows the influence of the art of Crete, his birthplace; Crete was a center for the Byzantine artistic tradition, emphasizing abstraction and pattern rather than recording natural appearances. From 1568 to 1577, El Greco lived in Venice and Rome, where Titian's broad brushwork and bright colors, Tintoretto's sweeping movement, and Michelangelo's monumental figures reshaped his Byzantine-influenced style. He was acclaimed for his penetrating portraits, but he also received ecclesiastical commissions throughout Spain, including important altarpieces. His paintings of Toledo are among Europe's first pure landscapes."," (Greek, 1541-1614)","6457"

"4384","Gérôme, Jean-Léon","Jean-Léon Gérôme","https://art.thewalters.org/browse/creator/jean-lcon-gcrme","male","Like that of his predecessors, Gérôme's art remained firmly wedded to the expressive human form, whether in subjects drawn from antiquity, the recent historical past, or his own recollections of exotic locales in the East. Gérôme disciplined himself to record accurately all that he observed, a skill that rewarded him richly in the multiple campaigns he made to Turkey and Egypt. The visual ""notes"" he took along the way, both drawn and painted, provided him with a trove of material to be synthesized again and again in large-scale compositions done in his studio in Paris.

As a wildly successful painter who never lacked for lucrative state commissions, Gérôme, understandably, became the target of avant-garde scorn. The maverick Realist Gustave Courbet (1819-77) made a point of naming his donkey after him, while critics like Émile Zola, who championed the ""new"" art of Édouard Manet (1832-83), cited artists like Gérôme as examples of the exhaustion of the academic tradition. Gérôme, however, could also be daringly experimental in his own right. Like Edgar Degas (1834-1917), with whom he was on friendly terms, he was fascinated by the new medium of photography and the insights into movement that its mechanical eye made possible. At the age of 50 he took up sculpture, developing a technique of painted marble in imitation of a practice known to have existed in antiquity. While these highly realistic, colored sculptures are little known today, they attest to the artist's ceaseless exploration of new ideas. Yet another sign of Gérôme's actual modernity was his capitalization on the newest reproductive technologies as a lucrative means of disseminating his art. In 1860, the artist had the wisdom to fall in love with the daughter of the well-established dealer Adolphe Goupil. The association with Goupil assured Gérôme's international popularity through widely disseminated reproductive prints and photographs of his paintings."," (French, 1824-1904)","12697, 17030, 18402, 17026, 18219, 15612, 3623, 14204, 22738, 31957, 32905, 36782, 37928, 77225, 77226, 79167, 79176, 36954, 79345"

"4535","Ingres, Jean-Auguste-Dominique","Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres","https://art.thewalters.org/browse/creator/jean-auguste-dominique-ingres","male","Ingres' art eludes easy classification. It exhibits both neoclassical traits associated at the time with academic conservatism and the visionary flights of fantasy usually ascribed to Neoclassicism's antithesis, Romanticism. Ingres entered the studio of Jacques-Louis David in 1797, where he was immediately impressed with the pure lines found in Greek vase painting as promoted by his master. However, Ingres would soon depart from the Neoclassicism of his mentor to develop a highly individual, even eccentric hybrid of Greek art, the art of early Renaissance masters such as Giotto (1266 or 1267-1337) and Fra Angelico (ca. 1400-55), and, especially, that of the High Renaissance artist Raphael (1483-1520). Ingres' reverence for the Italian masters was the result of years of study in Rome and Florence. He returned to Paris at the mature age of 44, where he pursued and eventually earned the usual honors of officialdom under successive regimes, winning important state commissions for large-scale history paintings. Although ultimately successful in his bid for such public commissions, Ingres is perhaps best remembered as one of the most insightful society portraitists of his age. His many exquisite depictions of women in sumptuous gowns and glittering jewelry are as admired today as they were when they were painted.

Although Ingres received important state commissions and official honors, he was permanently scarred by negative reviews of his work. His eclecticism sometimes resulted in a visual disjointedness that deviated too far from mainstream taste. Even his teacher, David, found his early portrait of Napoleon enthroned ""unintelligible."" Each project exacted an enormous toll on the artist, requiring many studies before a perfected ""solution"" was achieved. This often meant that he was late in finishing major commissions. For example, the ""Apotheosis of Homer"" was supposed to be exhibited at the 1827 Salon but wasn't ready until the Salon of 1833. Ingres' obsessiveness also led him to revisit favorite subjects over and over again, at times revising and retouching a canvas many years after its initial conception."," (French, 1780-1867)","6005, 18275, 7916, 22867"

Lewis attended Oberlin College in Ohio and in 1863 moved to Boston, where she received instruction from the sculptor Edward Brackett. Two years later, she left the United States for Rome. She adopted the prevailing neoclassical style of sculpture, as seen in this nude bust, but softened it with a degree of naturalism, as reflected in the rendering of the facial features. Most sculptors relied on the local craftsmen actually to carve their works, but Lewis, sensitive to speculation that she was not responsible for her sculptures, carved them personally. She had a successful career, specializing in biblical subjects, themes recalling her Native American and African ancestry, and portrait busts. Her sculpture ""The Death of Cleopatra"" was favorably received when it was shown at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876."," (American, 1844-1907)","6301"

He came from a well-to-do peasant family based in the French province of Normandy. In his early 20s, Millet moved to Paris, where he worked in the studio of Paul Delaroche (1797-1856) before unsuccessfully competing for the privilege of studying in Rome. Although Millet initially focused on portraiture, he first enjoyed major success as a painter of peasant life following his 1849 move to the village of Barbizon to the southeast of Paris. His monumental peasant images of the 1850s, such as ""The Sower,"" attracted controversy when shown at the Paris Salon not only because of their gestural technique but also because they confronted the public with France's largely neglected underclass. The humanitarian social creed of Millet's work later inspired the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh (1853-90), who made several copies after the older painter's work.

During the 1860s, Millet increasingly focused on landscape painting. Around the same time, he began to produce a large number of pastels, and these have often been seen as the most innovative aspect of his art. Millet effectively fused color and line by intermingling hatched passages of black chalk and richly colored pastel. His methods influenced the later impressionists, such as Edgar Degas (1834-1917) and Camille Pissarro (1831-1903).

Millet used repetition as a means of rehearsing formal problems and treated the same subjects repeatedly over a period of decades. He explored repetition in a variety of media, including paintings, pastels, and lithographs."," (French, 1814-1875)","10990, 11004, 21057, 22652, 23217, 24760, 31158, 38102"

"7674","Monet, Claude","Claude Monet","https://art.thewalters.org/browse/creator/claude-monet","male","Today, Monet is regarded throughout the world as one of the most beloved painters of his generation. His art is thought of as synonymous with the aesthetic aims of the impressionist movement. The impressionists shocked the art world by their blatant disregard for conventional painting technique in favor of an unblended juxtaposition of often stridently clashing strokes of color, rather than a seamless gradation of tone from light to dark. Under the influence of his teacher, the seascape specialist Eugène Boudin (1824-98), the young Monet painted outdoors in order to record as faithfully as possible the landscape as actually perceived in changing conditions of light and climate. Monet met many of his fellow impressionists, such as Frédéric Bazille (1841-70), Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919), and Alfred Sisley (1839-99), while studying in the studio of Charles Gleyre (1806-74). In 1869, Monet painted outdoors, side by side with his friend Renoir, each delighting in the other's unique but still recognizable rendition of ""La Grenouillière,"" a popular recreational destination along the Seine River, just outside Paris. Such scenes of urban middle-class leisure became one of the staple subjects of the impressionist group.

Starting in the 1890s, Monet began to produce multiple canvases based on a single motif in what would become his favored format: the painted series. In 1891, he exhibited 15 ""Grainstack"" paintings in the commercial gallery of the Paris-based dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. The show was a critical and commercial success, and from that point on, painting in series became Monet's preferred approach. He would eventually go on to explore figureless, non-narrative subjects, such as the cliffs at Pourville in Normandy (exhibited 1898), views of the Thames River in London (exhibited 1904), or the water lilies in his garden at Giverny outside of Paris (exhibited 1909). The motivation behind Monet's series is typically presumed to rest on the artist's compulsion to record the flux of perception, moving from canvas to canvas in an effort to capture the ever-changing conditions of light and climate. However, while Monet often began canvases outdoors, he often retouched and completed the same canvases in the studio."," (French, 1840-1926)","10078, 31455"
