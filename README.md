Walters Art Museum Collections API
===============================================================================

Documentation and static data files, for the Walters Art Museum collections API. This API allows you to access data and images about works of art in our collection directly over HTTP. This document and the API described herein are subject to rapid change, as they are both still in development.

**note**: v1 of the Walters API closed in 2023. Until a v2 can come online, we  provide static data files via this repository.
