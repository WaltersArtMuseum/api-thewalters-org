This important collection includes not only paintings but also sculpture, furniture, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry, arms and armor, and locks and keys. The breadth of the Walters&rsquo; collection offers a comprehensive display of the arts during this artistically fertile period. The best-known works include Hugo van der Goes' <cite>Donor with Saint John the Baptist</cite>, Heemskerck&rsquo;s <cite>Panorama with the Abduction of Helen Amidst the Wonders of the Ancient World</cite>, Veronese&rsquo;s <cite>Portrait Of Countess Livia da Porto Thiene and her Daughter Porzia</cite>, El Greco's <cite>Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata</cite>, Bernini's <cite>Risen Christ</cite>, Tiepolo&rsquo;s Scipio <cite>Africanus Freeing Massiva</cite>, and <cite>The Ideal City</cite> attributed to Fra Carnavale.</p>","1021"

"8","Manuscripts and Rare Books","<p>With more than 900 illuminated manuscripts, 1,250 of the first printed books (ca. 1455 - 1500), and an important collection of post-1500 deluxe editions, this extraordinary collection chronicles the art of the book over more than 1,000 years. The collection is from all over the world, and from ancient to modern times. It features deluxe Gospel books from Armenia, Ethiopia, Byzantium, and Ottonian Germany, French and Flemish books of hours, as well as masterpieces of Safavid, Mughal and Ottoman manuscript illumination. It also includes important first printed editions of ancient texts by great thinkers such as Aristotle and Euclid, diaries written by Napoleon and intricate bindings crafted by Tiffany. The early printed book collection highlights the experimental nature of the first attempts at printing. Some of these books have been illuminated by hand, and many are unique objects.&nbsp;</p>","726"
"9","Jewelry","<p>The array of exquisite jewelry at the Walters Art Museum represents an enormous range of periods, regions, artistic and stylistic developments and materials. The collection includes many pieces purchased by Henry Walters, as well as extensive donations by museum supporters including Henry Walters&rsquo; niece Laura Delano and New York gemologist Benjamin Zucker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signature objects include a magnificent pair of gold bracelets encrusted with precious stones and multicolored enamel inlay discovered in a tomb in Olbia, in present-day Ukrane, and dating to the 1<sup>st</sup> century B.C.; a pair of eagle <em>fibulae</em> from 6<sup>th</sup>-century Visigothic Spain; and an iris corsage ornament by Tiffany &amp; Co. decorated with 139 sapphires and other gems that was a grand prize winner at the 1900 Paris Exposition universelle.</p>","10"
"10","Japanese Military Armor","<p>Most of the Japanese military objects William and Henry Walters collected were made during the Edo (1615-1867) and Meiji (1868-1912) periods. During these years, Japan was largely at peace. There was still a military class (the samurai), but they rarely engaged in active battle. Arms and armor became an outward symbol of status among the military class. Once Westerners were able to freely enter Japan after 1854, swords and sword fittings became popular items to collect. Some of the fittings in the Walters collection were made specifically for sale to Westerners and were never mounted on swords.</p>
<p>One of the most popular sword fittings among collectors was the &ldquo;tsuba&rdquo; or sword guard. Tsubas are placed at the end of the sword handle, or &ldquo;tsuka,&rdquo; to protect the bearer&rsquo;s hand from being cut. Adjacent to the tsuba is a small decorated ring called the &ldquo;fuchi.&rdquo; This surrounds the opening on the handle and is usually paired with a &ldquo;kashira&rdquo; that covers the pommel end of the handle. On either side of the handle were &ldquo;menuki.&rdquo; These were originally developed because they helped the bearer maintain his grip on the handle, but later became strictly decorative adornments. The scabbard covering the blade is called the &ldquo;saya.&rdquo; In addition to shielding the sword, it often has openings along the outside to hold a utility knife and a hairpin, chopsticks or a tool designed to spur a horse. The decorated handle of the utility knife is called the &ldquo;kozuka.&rdquo; The other items are called &ldquo;kogai,&rdquo; warikogai&rdquo; and &ldquo;umabari.&rdquo; In some cases all of these fittings were made as a set by one artist, but more frequently three or four different artists would make the pieces used in one mounting.</p>","1331"

Islamic art includes not only objects used in the service of religion but also those created for the courts of the Middle East and Central Asia, as well as articles used in everyday life, over a territory that at its height stretched from present-day Spain and North Africa westward to India. The museum&rsquo;s holdings reflect the cultural diversity and geographical range of Islamic cultures.</p>
<p>Islamic achievements in all artistic media are represented at the Walters. Among the highlights are a 7th-century carved and hammered silver bowl from Iran that demonstrates the continuation of Sassanian traditions in early Muslim Persia; a 13th-century candlestick made of copper, silver, and gold from Mamluk Egypt; 16th-century mausoleum doors decorated with intricate wood carvings in a radiating star pattern; a delicate 17th-century silk sash from Moghul India; and a 17th-century Turkish tile with an image of the Great Mosque of Mecca.</p>","166"
"13","Islamic Manuscripts","<p>The Walters&rsquo; collection of Islamic Manuscripts showcases masterpieces of illuminated and illustrated manuscripts. The sacred, devotional and non-religious manuscripts presented here were created across the breadth of the Islamic world and date from the 9th through the 19th century. In the Islamic book, the primary vehicle for literary and artistic expression, the powers of poetry, prayer and visual form collide. They bear witness to remarkable achievements in literature and the book arts. Examples include a 15th-century Koran from northern India, executed at the height of the Timurid empire; a luxurious 16th-century copy of the <cite>Khamsa</cite> by Amir Khusraw, illustrated by a number of famous artists for the emperor Akbar; and a Turkish calligraphy album by Sheik Handullah al Amasi, one of the greatest calligraphers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All images of Islamic manuscripts were created and are provided through a Preservation and Access grant awarded to The Walters Art Museum by the National Endowment for the Humanities, 2008-2010.</p>","1"

"15","Ethiopia","<p>The Walters' collection of Ethiopian icons, manuscripts, and processional crosses is one of the largest collections outside of Ethiopia. Historically, Ethiopia was a Christian kingdom with strong ties in both trade and religion to the cultures located around the Mediterranean. Ethiopia's Christian tradition dates back to the 4th century, when the ruler of the Aksumite kingdom converted to Christianity; by the 15th century, this African nation had developed a tradition of icon painting that rivaled that of the Orthodox empires.&nbsp;</p>","46"

Chinese porcelains from the Ming and Qing dynasties were some of William T. Walters&rsquo;s first purchases in the mid-nineteenth century and they form the foundation of the museum&rsquo;s Asian collections. With the addition to important Buddhist sculptures, carved jades, ancient bronzes, paintings, and calligraphies, Henry Walters rounded out the Chinese collection so that it precisely reflects the early twentieth-century American vision of China. &nbsp;</p>","800"
"17","Byzantium and Early Russia","<p>The Walters Art Museum holds one of the leading collections of Byzantine Art in the United States. Henry Walters took an early interest in Byzantine art, buying at a time when there were limited collectors in this field. The strengths of the Walters&rsquo; collection include a group of over two thousand decorative tile fragments, the Hama collection of liturgical silver and illuminated manuscripts. The Walters&rsquo; Byzantine art is supported by an important collection of Russian and Orthodox icons.</p>","243"

This room, with its hundreds of natural history wonders displayed with marvels of human ingenuity from all corners of the world, offers an unparalleled opportunity to experience the excitement of the Age of Exploration in Europe.

Now strengthened by long-term loans and generous gifts from private collectors, the Ancient American collection features exceptional works of art from Central and South America, including masterpieces from the Mesoamerican Olmec, Aztec, and Maya cultures, as well as the Moche and Inca peoples of eastern South America.</p>
<p>The artworks revolve around a core set of themes, including agricultural fertility, the role of the ruler in forging a bond between the natural and supernatural realms, and the practice of shamanism, which included the ritual of uniting with an animal spirit.</p>
<p>Most of the objects, made of gold, jade, turquoise, shell, or clay, were found in tombs, intended to equip the deceased for his journey to the next world. The ancient American art collection includes extraordinary sculptures, masks, game objects, figurative and painted vases, as well as gold jewelry and ritual works. The installation is especially strong in objects from Mesoamerica (including present-day Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, the Intermediate Area of Central America and northern Colombia), and the Andean civilizations of Ecuador and Peru.
