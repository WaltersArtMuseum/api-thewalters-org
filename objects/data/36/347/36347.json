The first work is called Lavayih and consists of a collection of apophthegms. The second work is a commentary on the famous Arabic \"Wine poem\" (Khamriyah) by 'Umar ibn Farid (died 632 AH/AD 1235). The third work is a commentary on the \"Song of the flute\" from the beginning of the Masnavi of Jalal al-Din Rumi (died 672 AH/AD 1273). The manuscript was written in Nasta'liq script by the well-known Iranian calligrapher Baba Shah ibn Sultan 'Ali Isfahani in 999 AH/AD 1591. There is a note dated to the year 1105 AH/AD 1694 on fol. 1a indicating that the manuscript is made up of 2 papers: Samarqandi (for the text) and Dawlatabadi (for the margins). There are also seals dating between the 11th century AH/AD 17th and the13th century AH/AD 19th.",
